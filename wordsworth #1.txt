BUT Cytherea, studious to invent
 Arts yet untried, upon new counsels bent, 
Resolves that Cupid, changed in form and face
To young Ascanius, should assume his place; 
Present the maddening gifts, and kindle heat 
Of passion at the bosom's inmost seat. 
She dreads the treacherous house, the double tongue; 
She burns, she frets--by Juno's rancour stung; 
The calm of night is powerless to remove 
These cares, and thus she speaks to winged Love:  
'O son, my strength, my power! who dost despise 
(What, save thyself, none dares through earth and skies) 
The giant-quelling bolts of Jove, I flee, 
O son, a suppliant to thy deity! 
What perils meet Aeneas in his course, 
How Juno's hate with unrelenting force 
Pursues thy brother--this to thee is known; 
And oft-times hast thou made my griefs thine own. 
Him now the generous Dido by soft chains 
Of bland entreaty at her court detains;  
Junonian hospitalities prepare 
Such apt occasion that I dread a snare. 
Hence, ere some hostile God can intervene, 
Would I, by previous wiles, inflame the queen 
With passion for Aeneas, such strong love 
That at my beck, mine only, she shall move. 
Hear, and assist;--the father's mandate calls 
His young Ascanius to the Tyrian walls; 
He comes, my dear delight,--and costliest things 
Preserved from fire and flood for presents brings.  
Him will I take, and in close covert keep, 
'Mid groves Idalian, lulled to gentle sleep, 
Or on Cythera's far-sequestered steep, 
That he may neither know what hope is mine, 
Nor by his presence traverse the design. 
Do thou, but for a single night's brief space, 
Dissemble; be that boy in form and face! 
And when enraptured Dido shall receive 
Thee to her arms, and kisses interweave 
With many a fond embrace, while joy runs high,  
And goblets crown the proud festivity, 
Instil thy subtle poison, and inspire, 
At every touch, an unsuspected fire.' 
Love, at the word, before his mother's sight 
Puts off his wings, and walks, with proud delight, 
Like young Iulus; but the gentlest dews 
Of slumber Venus sheds, to circumfuse 
The true Ascanius steeped in placid rest; 
Then wafts him, cherished on her careful breast, 
Through upper air to an Idalian glade,  
Where he on soft 'amaracus' is laid, 
With breathing flowers embraced, and fragrant shade. 
But Cupid, following cheerily his guide 
Achates, with the gifts to Carthage hied; 
And, as the hall he entered, there, between 
The sharers of her golden couch, was seen 
Reclined in festal pomp the Tyrian queen. 
The Trojans, too (Aeneas at their head), 
On conches lie, with purple overspread: 
Meantime in canisters is heaped the bread,  
Pellucid water for the hands is borne, 
And napkins of smooth texture, finely shorn. 
Within are fifty handmaids, who prepare, 
As they in order stand, the dainty fare; 
And fume the household deities with store 
Of odorous incense; while a hundred more 
Matched with an equal number of like age, 
But each of manly sex, a docile page, 
Marshal the banquet, giving with due grace 
To cup or viand its appointed place.  
The Tyrians rushing in, an eager band, 
Their painted couches seek, obedient to command. 
They look with wonder on the gifts--they gaze 
Upon Iulus, dazzled with the rays 
That from his ardent countenance are flung, 
And charmed to hear his simulating tongue; 
Nor pass unpraised the robe and veil divine, 
Round which the yellow flowers and wandering foliage twine. 
But chiefly Dido, to the coming ill 
Devoted, strives in vain her vast desires to fill;  
She views the gifts; upon the child then turns 
Insatiable looks, and gazing burns. 
To ease a father's cheated love he hung 
Upon Aeneas, and around him clung; 
Then seeks the queen; with her his arts he tries; 
She fastens on the boy enamoured eyes, 
Clasps in her arms, nor weens (O lot unblest!) 
How great a God, incumbent o'er her breast, 
Would fill it with his spirit. He, to please 
His Acidalian mother, by degrees  
Blots out Sichaeus, studious to remove 
The dead, by influx of a living love, 
By stealthy entrance of a perilous guest. 
Troubling a heart that had been long at rest. 
Now when the viands were withdrawn, and ceased 
The first division of the splendid feast, 
While round a vacant board the chiefs recline, 
Huge goblets are brought forth; they crown the wine; 
Voices of gladness roll the walls around; 
Those gladsome voices from the courts rebound;  
From gilded rafters many a blazing light 
Depends, and torches overcome the night. 
The minutes fly--till, at the queen's command, 
A bowl of state is offered to her hand: 
Then she, as Belus wont, and all the line 
From Belus, filled it to the brim with wine; 
Silence ensued. 'O Jupiter, whose care 
Is hospitable dealing, grant my prayer! 
Productive day be this of lasting joy 
To Tyrians, and these exiles driven from Troy;  
A day to future generations dear! 
Let Bacchus, donor of soul-quick'ning cheer, 
Be present; kindly Juno, be thou near! 
And, Tyrians, may your choicest favours wait 
Upon this hour, the bond to celebrate!' 
She spake and shed an offering on the board; 
Then sipped the bowl whence she the wine had poured 
And gave to Bitias, urging the prompt lord; 
He raised the bowl, and took a long deep draught; 
Then every chief in turn the beverage quaffed.  
Graced with redundant hair, Iopas sings 
The lore of Atlas, to resounding strings, 
The labours of the Sun, the lunar wanderings; 
When human kind, and brute; what natural powers 
Engender lightning, whence are falling showers. 
He haunts Arcturus,--that fraternal twain 
The glittering Bears,--the Pleiads fraught with rain; 
--Why suns in winter, shunning heaven's steep heights 
Post seaward,--what impedes the tardy nights. 
The learned song from Tyrian hearers draws  
Loud shouts,--the Trojans echo the applause. 
--But, lengthening out the night with converse new, 
Large draughts of love unhappy Dido drew; 
Of Priam asked, of Hector--o'er and o'er-- 
What arms the son of bright Aurora wore;-- 
What steeds the car of Diomed could boast; 
Among the leaders of the Grecian host. 
How looked Achilles, their dread paramount-- 
'But nay--the fatal wiles, O guest, recount, 
Retrace the Grecian cunning from its source,  
Your own grief and your friends?--your wandering course; 
For now, till this seventh summer have ye ranged 
The sea, or trod the earth, to peace estranged.'
